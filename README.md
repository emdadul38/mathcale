### Hey, visitor 👋🏾

I'm Matheus, a Software Engineer based on Rio de Janeiro/Brazil working for @AmeDigital. I'm currently focused (but not restricted to) on building serverless applications with Javascript and Golang and client-side apps with React, Next.js and React Native.

I also **love** to teach and share what I've learned so far. I'm willing to start a YouTube channel pretty soon, so stay tuned for that!
